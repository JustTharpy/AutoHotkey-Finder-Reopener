# TroubleChute Autohotkey Finder

The TroubleChute Autohotkey Finder is a Windows utility written in C++ that helps you locate and manage running AutoHotkey scripts on your system. It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and requires no additional redistributables to run.

This fixes increasingly common annoying Anti-Cheat errors like Battlefield 6's:
